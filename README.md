# Obsidian Git Sync
Push all new files and pull new files with a simple in editor command. Uses the Github Rest API, so you don't even have to install git on your computer.

## Configuration
- Install it as any other obsidian plugin
- Create and copy your repository name and username into the settings.
- Get an access token in your Github account with permissions to your note-repository and paste it into the settings

Use either the pull or push command now!
